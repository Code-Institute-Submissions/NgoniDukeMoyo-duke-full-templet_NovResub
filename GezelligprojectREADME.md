# User Experience

This project is targeted at a specific audience that feels the need to stay in a space of authenticity, 
a space that represent something of value to them •creativity, design and color•. Normally this particular audience 
can read/sense that feeling as soon as soon as they lay their eyes on the front door of the living space in its failure or success to stand out. 
If that front door does not represent that symbol then they quickly move on. This website aims to be that front door.

This audience wants to feel understood and appriciated by being complimented with an authentic living space to make them feel
welcome. This website is aimed to grab their attention straight off the bat as they look at the home page filled with the right criteria.

The audiencealso appriciate simplicity therefore as much as design and creativity is a big factor to create the website, 
simplicity in navigation and action is crucial therefore the website has no clatter and is easy to navigate. 

The header, navbar and footer in the home page, provide clear and simple info to make it as quick and easy interaction.
The body provides a small quick read history into the space for a background info to provide symbolism which will be appriciated (aunthenticity).

# features
This project is created in Gitpod workspace and pulled and stored to Github. Gitpod comes with a command line interface which came preset thanks to 
--Code Institute-- .The project is mostly constructed by HTML and CSS. I only took advantage of Bootstrap (https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.1.3/css/bootstrap.min.css)
 for the Gallery for create the nice neat columns for the images layout (rows and columns). All featured fonts are font-awesome fonts (version 5.15.2 -
  https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/5.15.2/css/all.min.css). I chose the font "Exo" because of out simple but neat impression which compliments
  the aim of the website itself.

  # challenges
  Currently struggling with the css for my footer. I am trouble shooting the media queries, footer container, the footer positioning, which i think are the problem but
  its possible to be a big issue to overcome as i am unable to pin-point the issue. I contacted student support and we were not very successful. (20/3)
