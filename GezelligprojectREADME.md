<!--Design-->
## Color Scheme
The main colors used are Maroon, teal and dar yellow.
I want to go on the wensite and be immidiately capitivated with the colors and the furniture with the way it is displayed, then simply press book.

## Typography
The Exo font family is the main font used throughout the whole website with San Serif as the fallback font incase the font isnt being imported into the site correctly.
I chose the font "Exo" because of its simplicity but neat impression which compliments the aim of the website itself.


## Imagery

The large heading image is designed to automatically prompt the viewer about the design, colors and idea of the space. This project is targeted at a specific audience that feels the need to stay in a space of authenticity, 
a space that represent something of value to them •creativity, design and color•. Normally this particular audience 
can read/sense that feeling as soon as soon as they lay their eyes on the front door of the living space in its failure or success to stand out. 
If that front door does not represent that symbol then they quickly move on. This website aims to be that front door.

This audience wants to feel understood and appriciated by being complimented with an authentic living space to make them feel
welcome. This website is aimed to grab their attention straight off the bat as they look at the home page filled with the right criteria.

The audiencealso appriciate simplicity therefore as much as design and creativity is a big factor to create the website, 
simplicity in navigation and action is crucial therefore the website has no clatter and is easy to navigate. 

The header, navbar and footer in the home page, provide clear and simple info to make it as quick and easy interaction.
The body provides a small quick read history into the space for a background info to provide symbolism which will be appriciated (aunthenticity).

<!--Challenges faced in Project-->
  # challenges
  Currently struggling with the css for my footer. I am trouble shooting the media queries, footer container, the footer positioning, which i think are the problem but
  its possible to be a big issue to overcome as i am unable to pin-point the issue. I contacted student support and we were not very successful. (20/3)

<!--Features of each Page-->
  ### Home Page Features

  (28th March) Bootstrap 4.1.3 (navbar) with inline style which made it easier to manipulate bootstrap elements. After having a session with my mentor, i was advised
  to move navbar to the top above all for usability "as soon as a user go on the site there must some standout evidence of what the site is about or navigation systems.
  Hence i chose to use Boottrap Collapse and positioning for the nav as it moves up top.

Mentor advised on the structure of the CSS which was causing my footer not to work as coded. The issue was alot of overriding css targets to the elements that
had also had css elements originally e.g targeting footer{} by using footer opposed to div i footer{}.
This allowed me to fix footer issue in css line 149.
