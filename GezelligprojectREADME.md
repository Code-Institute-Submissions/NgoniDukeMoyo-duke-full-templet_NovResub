# User Experience

This project is targeted at a specific audience that feels the need to stay in a space of authenticity, 
a space that represent something of value to them •creativity, design and color•. Normally this particular audience 
can read/sense that feeling as soon as soon as they lay their eyes on the front door of the living space in its failure or success to stand out. 
If that front door does not represent that symbol then they quickly move on. This website aims to be that front door.
