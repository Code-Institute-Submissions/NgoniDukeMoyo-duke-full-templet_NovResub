This is the main look for the website. The site is created to allow front user to explore the offered product (rented house) leading them to get in contact for an interest through booking page. It is designed to be responsive and accessible on mobile and large screen devices. Making it a simple easy navigation for all interested visitors.

The aim is to create a platform shwoing creativity that the target audience will take time to appriciate
as a rented living space. This focuses on beauty with an eye for design and colors more than quantity and the product itself.

# Testing User Stories From User Experiences (UX) Section
1. Upon entering the site, users are greeting with a simple and clear usage of the navigation bar stating nivigation, With only 3 clearly labeled buttons for the prefered action of where to go. There content is then clearly written in the body with imagery and video for different perspective. As use scrolls down to the footer, they are greeting by strong maroon color and till for the content and purpose to stand out and be more clear for the user.
2. For those user relying on experiences or other thoughts of recent visitor, in the footer they are given an opportunity to visit the social community to find ouy for about the product and hear from others what makes us better than the rest and offeres.
3. The contact form and booking form portrays easy usage for the user, with placeholder text to guide users of the required information.

<!--Design-->
## Color Scheme
The main colors used are Maroon, teal and dark yellow.
I want to go on the website and be immidiately capitivated with the colors and the furniture with the way it is displayed, then simply press book.

## Typography
The Exo font family is the main font used throughout the whole website with San Serif as the fallback font incase the font isnt being imported into the site correctly.
I chose the font "Exo" because of its simplicity but neat impression which compliments the aim of the website itself.


## Imagery
This project is targeted at a specific audience that feels the need to stay in a space of authenticity, 
a space that represent something of value to them •creativity, design and color•. Normally this particular audience 
can read/sense that feeling as soon as soon as they lay their eyes on the front door of the living space in its failure or success to stand out. 
If that front door does not represent that symbol then they quickly move on. This website aims to be that front door.

This audience wants to feel understood and appriciated by being complimented with an authentic living space to make them feel
welcome. This website is aimed to grab their attention straight off the bat as they look at the home page filled with the right criteria.

The audiencealso appriciate simplicity therefore as much as design and creativity is a big factor to create the website, 
simplicity in navigation and action is crucial therefore the website has no clatter and is easy to navigate. 

The header, navbar and footer in the home page, provide clear and simple info to make it as quick and easy interaction.
The body provides a small quick read history into the space for a background info to provide symbolism which will be appriciated (aunthenticity).

<!--Challenges faced in Project-->
  # challenges
  Currently struggling with the css for my footer. I am trouble shooting the media queries, footer container, the footer positioning, which i think are the problem but
  its possible to be a big issue to overcome as i am unable to pin-point the issue. I contacted student support and we were not very successful. (20/3)
  - (fix) Mentor helped realise i was using wrong positioning elements and wrong footer targets for the footer in MediaQueries.
  Issues with the Navbar Bootstrap toogle not dropping down the toogle nav menu
  -(fix) order of script for JQuery and Bootstrap cdn
  Issues with the project not staging all the commits and pushing them to Github.
  - This was caused because of a large video file (150MB) and was stopping all the commits to push.
